# Welcome to GatewayScript Bootcamp!

##### Let's get started
In order to start gatewayscripting, you need to get a few things installed first.
While you might not be familiar with these tools, don't worry - this is a one timer and we will escort you though the process of installing everything to get you started.

##### What do we need?
1) git client - We uploaded everything to GitHub, using git you'll be able to pull everything to your workstation.
2) docker - Your very own DataPower instance will run on top of docker.

__The instructions presented here assume you are using Windows 7/8:__
DockerToolbox provides us a virtual machine that runs docker on top of it.
Download DockerToolbox from here: https://download.docker.com/win/stable/DockerToolbox.exe

Install Docker Toolbox following the installation wizard.
__Make sure you choose full installation (Including gicmdt).__

###### Let's get our docker environment ready.
Open cmd
Execute the following command:
docker-machine create --virtualbox-cpu-count "3" --virtualbox-memory "4096" boot2docker
```docker pull ibmcom/datapower:7.5.2.8.289749```

We created a special IDE so it'll be a lot more fun to develop with :)
```git clone https://github.com/Tangram-Soft/dpanda.ide.git```

once git is done, run the following:
```cd dpanda.ide
docker create -it -v %cd%:/drouter/config -v %cd%/local:/drouter/local -p 9090:9090 -p 9080:9080 -p 22:22 -p 8000-8010:8000-8010 -p 5550:5550 -p 5554:5554 -e DATAPOWER_ACCEPT_LICENSE=true -e DATAPOWER_INTERACTIVE=true --name idg.dpanda ibmcom/datapower:7.5.2.8.289749
docker start idg.dpanda
```

Then run the following:
```
switch dpanda;co;crypto;keygen CN dpanda-gui rsa 2048 gen-sscert;exit;exit;switch default
user dpanda;access-level privileged;password dpanda;suppress-password-change;exit
```

Go to https://[docker-machine ip]/dpanda/webIDE.html

Now we can begin!
