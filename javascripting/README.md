# Javascripting
If you want to get started with the very basics of JavaScript in general, we suggest you follow nodeschool's "javascripting" tutorial.
We are familiar with this tutorial, so if you get stuck, the people around you can assist :)

nodeschool's tutorials are based on nodejs, so you'll have to download node.js first.
Once you are done installing, you can get started here:
